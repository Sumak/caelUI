-- event = "PLAYER_FLAGS_CHANGED"

--   If it was, then check to see if the player has changed flags because they
--   have gone Away. If they have, start the AFK state, else make sure we are in
--   a stopped AFK state.
-- event = "PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED"
--   This means the player has left combat and we can move the camera and show
--   the dimmer frame again.
-- event = "PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED"
--   This means the player has entered combat and we need to stop our player's
--   camera and dimmer frame from being shown.
